Hi! I'm Adrian and this is a portfolio project I did in collaboration with the non-profit organisation [Mein Grundeinkommen e.V.](https://www.mein-grundeinkommen.de/) to showcase my skills as a Data Analyst.

In this project I explored an anonymized user database using the following skills and technologies:

## Skills
- Data Wrangling & Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Communication of Insights

## Technologies
- Python 3.7 (pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn , GeoPandas and psycopg2)
- PostgreSQL
- Jupyter Notebook

As this is a real user database I did all aggregations and analyses beforehand and uploaded only those datasets necessary for plotting. 

## Content

Mein Grundeinkommen e.V. is a non-profit organisation trying to advance the discussion and knowledge about the unconditional basic income (ubi) in Germany by raffling off crowdfunded ubi's. 

As of Nov.'19 Mein Grundeinkommen did not have the resources to do in-depth Data Analysis. Thus my analysis aims to answer some key questions to develop an understanding of the users and donors of Mein Grundeinkommen e.V., for example:
- When do people sign up as users/become donors?
- Are certain people more engaged in the idea of a unconditional basic income than others?
- How much do people donate? Is this all depended on a few big donors?
